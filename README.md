# SmartStoreBilling-System
This is a modular, file-based billing system developed in Python that simulates a basic electronic store purchase workflow. The application allows customers to view available products, purchase items with quantity validation, apply discount rules based on total purchase value, and automatically generate a detailed invoice in text format.

The system maintains real-time inventory updates by reading from and writing to a product stock file, ensuring accurate stock management after each transaction. The project is structured using multiple Python modules to demonstrate clean separation of concerns, input validation, and practical file handling.
